# AETHER: Autonomous Elderly Ecosystem for Total Health Emergency Response & Optimization

## 0) Executive Concept
AETHER is an end-to-end Elderly Care OS that combines **ambient sensing + wearables + edge AI + agentic GenAI** to prevent emergencies, detect them instantly when they occur, and coordinate real-world response (family, neighbors, nurses, telehealth, emergency services).  
It inherits Nomi’s core blueprint—multi-sensor network, on-device fall/posture detection (no video leaves device), cloud pipeline, AI insights, and caregiver alerts—and expands it into a production-grade ecosystem with specialized models per task. [page:5]

---

## 1) Problem Statement (Hackathon Theme Included)
Design and build next-generation GenAI solutions that address real-world challenges across digital media, fintech, education, healthcare, sustainability, smart cities, and open novel innovation.

### Problem Statement (Idea Submission)
Elderly people living independently face cascading risks (falls, missed medications, dehydration/malnutrition, sleep decline, heat stress, wandering, delirium, and caregiver burnout) that are often detected late, while most monitoring systems are either invasive, fragmented, or too noisy to trust.

### Who it impacts
- Seniors aging in place, dementia/frailty risk, chronic conditions
- Family caregivers (often remote) and neighborhood/community responders
- Home-care nurses, assisted living staff
- Telehealth clinicians and emergency departments (avoidable escalations)

### Motivation
Nomi shows that low-cost sensors + AWS pipeline + on-device posture detection + an LLM reasoning layer can deliver privacy-preserving monitoring and caregiver-ready insights. [page:5]  
VitalCue demonstrates turning smartwatch data into actionable insights using Gemma, and AURA demonstrates objective triage insights using MedGemma and Vertex AI—both patterns AETHER repurposes for the home. [page:6]  
Copi demonstrates that passive ingestion across everyday channels and a timeline-style “source of truth” reduces workflow friction and increases adoption—AETHER generalizes this for elderly care operations. [page:3]  
ZophIA.tech shows speech-based mental health evaluation support as a direction AETHER can modularize for cognition/mood drift signals. [page:4]

### Application
**Where used:** homes, assisted living, community health programs, remote caregiving.  
**Primary workflow:** prevent → detect → triage → coordinate response → document outcomes → learn personalized baselines.

  - Stores only derived features (snore/cough counts), not raw audio by default

#### F) AETHER Mobility Layer (Fall + Gait + Posture)
**Privacy-first default** mirrors Nomi: on-device posture/fall inference; video never leaves the device. [page:5]
- Option 1: Pose-only edge camera
  - Wide-angle camera pointed at “safe zones” (corridor near bathroom)
  - On-device pose extraction; upload only pose vectors + event labels (no frames)
- Option 2: Wearable IMU band (backup path)

## 3) Model Suite (Different Models for Different Use Cases)

AETHER uses a **routing strategy**: small/fast models for detection + larger reasoning models only for summarization/triage, plus specialized models for medical text and speech.

### 3.1 Edge Models (Safety-Critical, Low Latency)
1) Pose & posture extraction (Edge):
- MediaPipe Pose / BlazePose-style pipeline (CPU/GPU)
- Output: skeleton keypoints, posture class, fall probability

2) Fall event classifier (Edge):
- Model: lightweight temporal classifier over pose vectors (TCN/1D-CNN/LSTM)
- Output: {fall_detected, confidence, inactivity_after_fall}

3) Room-activity classifier (Edge, camera-free alternative):
- Model: sensor fusion model over PIR/mmWave/door/pressure sensors (XGBoost/LightGBM)
- Output: ADL states (sleeping, eating, bathroom visit, out-of-home)

4) On-device speech feature extraction (Optional):
- Model: VAD + embeddings (stores embeddings/features, not raw audio by default)

### 3.2 Cloud Models (Reasoning + Summarization + Operations)

#### A) “Care Coach” Reasoning LLM (Core)
- Baseline compatible with Nomi: NVIDIA NIM running Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B for plain-language, structured reasoning over sensor data. [page:5]
- Output schema: JSON with evidence pointers (event IDs, time windows), uncertainty, safe actions.

#### B) Wearable Insight LLM (Preventive Signals)
- Inspired by VitalCue converting smartwatch data to actionable insights using Gemma. [page:6]
- Model: Gemma-family LLM for efficient daily summaries + trend interpretation.

- Inspired by AURA providing objective triage insights built with MedGemma and Vertex AI. [page:6]
- Model: MedGemma for medical phrasing, symptom triage templates, and clinical summarization.

#### D) Timeline + Passive Ingestion Extractor
- Inspired by Copi’s passive ingestion + timeline pattern. [page:3]
- Models:
  - Multimodal extractor for images/docs (OCR + VLM)
  - Text classifier to convert messages into structured events (med change, symptom report, appointment, mood)
- Output: normalized “Care Timeline Events” with confidence and provenance.

#### E) Voice/Call Agent Models (CareOps Automation)
- Use-case: pharmacy calls, appointment scheduling, neighbor escalation.
- Models:
  - ASR model (low latency)
  - Dialogue policy model (tool-using agent)

- Shared tasks + SLAs:
  - meds refill, groceries, check-in calls, appointment booking
- Caregiver load balancing:
  - route tasks to whoever is available; burnout-aware scheduling

### 6.5 Clinical Bridge (Optional)
- Home triage cards inspired by AURA’s objective triage insight concept. [page:6]
- “Post-discharge mode”:
  - convert discharge instructions into tasks + reminders + monitoring triggers
- FHIR export:

- Privacy modes:
  - Event-only (default)
  - Event + derived stats
  - Event + pose vectors (still no raw video)
- “Explain my alert” and “Explain suppression”
- Tamper detection + sensor health monitoring
- Cryptographic audit log of events and actions
